Problem: Coin Change

You are given an integer array coins representing different denominations and an integer amount.
Return the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount.
If that amount cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.
You may assume you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

Input Format:
First line: integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 12) - number of coin denominations
Second line: n space-separated integers (1 ≤ coins[i] ≤ 100)
Third line: integer amount (0 ≤ amount ≤ 10^4)

Output Format:
An integer representing the minimum number of coins, or -1 if impossible

Example:
Input:
3
1 2 5
11

Output:
3

Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1 (3 coins)
