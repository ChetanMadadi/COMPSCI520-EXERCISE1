Problem: Shortest Path in Binary Matrix

Given an n x n binary matrix, find the length of the shortest path from top-left (0,0) to bottom-right (n-1,n-1).
You can only move through cells with value 0, and you can move in 8 directions (including diagonals).
If no path exists, return -1.

Input Format:
First line: integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)
Next n lines: n space-separated integers (0 or 1)

Output Format:
An integer representing the shortest path length, or -1 if no path exists

Example:
Input:
3
0 1 0
0 0 0
1 0 0

Output:
4

Explanation: Path is (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2)
